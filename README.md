### Comparative Performance Analysis of Tree Structures

#### Overview
This project presents a comparative analysis of three tree structures: AVL, Scapegoat, and Red-Black Trees. The objective is to evaluate their performance in terms of insertion, deletion, and search operations, using a consistent dataset of 20,000 strings.

#### Methodology
Implemented in C++, each tree structure was evaluated under standardized conditions. Time and space complexities were measured for each operation, providing insights into their efficiency and suitability for various applications.

#### Key Findings
- **Insertion:** Scapegoat and Red-Black trees demonstrated superior performance compared to AVL trees.
- **Deletion:** Red-Black trees exhibited the fastest deletion times across all dataset sizes.
- **Search:** Red-Black trees consistently showed the fastest search times.

#### Conclusion
Red-Black trees emerged as the preferred choice for balanced tree structures, offering efficient performance across all operations. Scapegoat trees provided a balance between performance and simplicity, while AVL trees remain suitable for scenarios requiring strict balance.
