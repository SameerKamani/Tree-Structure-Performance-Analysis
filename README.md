# Tree-Structure-Performance-Analysis
 This repository hosts a comparative analysis of three tree structures: AVL, Scapegoat, and Red-Black Trees. Through standardized evaluations, we assess their performance in insertion, deletion, and search operations using a consistent dataset. Explore the findings to make informed decisions about tree structure selection for your projects.
